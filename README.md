# Joomla-Components-Exploits-Auto-Updating-Scanner

This is a simple auto-updating Joomla! Plugins Scanner which is able to find exploits related to previously found components.
It uses the csv file provided by the Exploit-DB team and an extra plugins' list from Metasploit, but it is totally indipendent from this last one.
