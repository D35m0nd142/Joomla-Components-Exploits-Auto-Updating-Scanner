<h3> What is Joomla! Components/Exploits Auto-Updating Scanner? </h3>

This is a simple <b>auto-updating</b> Joomla! Plugins Scanner able to find installed components and relative exploits.
It uses the csv file provided by the Exploit-DB team and an extra plugins' list from Metasploit, but it is <b>totally independent</b> from this last one.

* * * 

<h3> Features </h3>

* Automatic scanning for Joomla! components
* Automatic retrieving of Joomla! exploits related to previous found components
* Automatic components/exploits update and download (recommended)
* It gives the user the chance to use a local file containing components to scan
* Tor Proxy tunnel available

> <b>[FLOODING]</b> If the target is protected by flooding requests the script won't be successful clearly.

Script's Programming Language support: <b>Python 2.7.* </b>

Note: You could have not installed some of the required libraries but it will install them for you <b>PROVIDED</b> you run the script as root. Besides you need to install pip in order to get missing libraries quickly.

If you bump into any kind of bug don't hesitate to contact me at <b><d35m0nd142@gmail.com></b> or follow me on Twitter as <b>@D35m0nd142</b>.

That's all. Enjoy it! ;-)
