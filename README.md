# Joomla-Components-Exploits-Auto-Updating-Scanner

![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/D35m0nd142/Joomla-Components-Exploits-Auto-Updating-Scanner/master/Screenshot.JPG)

This is a simple auto-updating Joomla! Plugins Scanner which is able to find exploits related to previously found components.
It uses the csv file provided by the Exploit-DB team and an extra plugins' list from Metasploit, but it is <b>totally indipendent</b> from this last one.
<b>TOR Proxy</b> tunnel available.

<b>[FLOODING]</b> If the target is protected by flooding requests the script won't be successful clearly.

Script's Programming Language support: <b>Python 2.7.* </b>

Note: You could have not installed some of the required libraries but it will install them for you <b>PROVIDED</b> you run the script as root. Besides you need to install pip in order to get missing libraries quickly.

If you bump into any kind of bug don't hesitate to contact me at <b><d35m0nd142@gmail.com></b> or follow me on Twitter as <b>@D35m0nd142</b>.

That's all. Enjoy it! ;-)
